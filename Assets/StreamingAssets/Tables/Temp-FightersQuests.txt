-- These Fighter's Guild quests are considered "mostly working" under quest system in current state
-- Please use the Quest Hub forums for bug reports: http://forums.dfworkshop.net/viewforum.php?f=25

-- "reward bug" is a script error where reward is given before quest completed
-- "questor clear bug" is a script error where clicking on questor will cause quest to end immediately after target complete
-- "no hot-placement" is a DFU bug where resources cannot be placed to an active interior/dungeon. Need to exit and re-enter interior
-- "needs more action support" means DFU quest system needs more development for these quests to work properly.
